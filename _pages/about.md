I am currently doing a Ph.D. at North Carolina State University in the Computer Science department. My research area is mostly within web security. In the past, I mostly worked in academia as a lecturer. In addition, I worked for small size companies as a web developer and successfully published the projects. My passion lies in developing secure web solutions. Currently interested in progressive web apps (PWA) development because I believe it will be larger than mobile application in the future.

During a free time I like to read books about business, money, and sales, exersizing and spending time with my family.
