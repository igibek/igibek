I am a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University in the Computer Science department. My research area is within software supply chain security and JavaScript security (npm, ElectronJS, web applications). In the past, I spent time working in academia as a senior-lecturer. In addition, I worked for small-size companies as a software engineer and successfully published multiple projects. My passion lies in developing secure web/software solutions. Nowadays, my interests lie in supply-chain security, threat modeling, and penetration testing of CI/CD and distributed systems. Also, I follow web assembly, and PWA (progressive web applications)

During my free time, I love to spend time with my family, sharing the knowledge with high school and university students. I advocate for Capture the Flag competitions, and believe that the security must be taught in high schools.
