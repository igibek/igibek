### Overview
The project is still under development stage. We hope to launch it in the summer 2019. You can access it [here](http://tusopsi.com). My role in this project is to develop a secure and fast (very fast) web application, that users can use. Thus, I am responsible for choosing the technology, building the architecture and developing the web app itself. During my research process, I decided to use ASP.NET Core MVC as a core technology for the project. ~~During development stage we are using shared hosting provider, but in the near future we may migrate to MS Azure~~. In the last moment, we decided to use [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/27b7d5a9f1eb) platform. 

### Technology stack
One of the goals while deciding about technology was it's openness. I didn't want to be dependent on some technology vendor. Before this project, I was mostly using Microsoft technologies. (ASP.NET MVC, MSSQL and Azure). At the end, I came up with this technology stack to develop the application. Of course, this stack comes with its own challenges, which I will discuss below.
- Framework: Asp.net Core MVC
- Database: MySQL
- Web Server: Nginx 
- Platform: [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/27b7d5a9f1eb)
