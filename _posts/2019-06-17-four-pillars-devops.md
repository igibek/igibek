## Introduction

I recently started reading "[Effective DevOps](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-DevOps-Building-Collaboration-Affinity/dp/1491926309/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=effective+devops&qid=1560828628&s=gateway&sr=8-1)" by Jennifer Davis and Katherine Daniels. I skipped most of the first part of the book about what is devops, the history of the devops and similar topics and decided to concentrate to the core of the book. I decided to write series of posts where I will share some interesting ideas that I found during the reading of the book.

The authors state that there are exist four pillars of the effective devops. By implementing those pillars organization can resolve both culture and technical challenges that may arise during software development cycle.

These are four pillars:
1. Collaboration
2. Affinity
3. Tools
4. Scaling

## Collaboration
Collaboration is about how well individuals inside a single team collaborate between each other. This is important step before starting to collaborate with other teams. 


## Affinity
Affinity is one level higher than collaboration in a sense, that it is more about relationship between various teams and departments within an organization. According to authors affinity can be also applied withing different organizations. 

## Tools
Tools are an accelarators, driving change based on the current culture and direction. If tools, or lack thereof, get in the way of individuals or teams working well together, your initiative will not succeed. 

## Scaling
Scaling is a focus on the process and pivots that organization must adopt throughout their lifecycles. Beyond simply considering what it means to address devops in large enterprise organizations, scaling takes into account how the other pillars of effective devops can be applied throughout organizations as they grow, mature, or even shrink.
