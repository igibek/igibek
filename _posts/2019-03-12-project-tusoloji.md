The project is still under development stage. We hope to launch it in the summer 2019. You can access it [here](https://tusopsi.com). My role in this project is to develop a secure and fast (very fast) web application, that users can use. Thus, I am responsible for choosing the technology, building the architecture and developing the web app itself. During my research process, I decided to use ASP.NET Core MVC as a core technology for the project. During development stage we are using shared hosting provider, but in the near future we may migrate to MS Azure.
