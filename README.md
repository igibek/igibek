# Hi!

**Bio:**
I graduated from North Carolina State University with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2023. Since then I have been working for Qualcomm as a security engineer. My main research interests lie in software supply chain and web security. 

I am passionate about secure coding practices, application security, and penetration testing.
